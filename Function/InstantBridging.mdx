Meme Bridge enables instant cross-chain bridging operations (including deposit and withdrawal functions) on the blockchain networks it supports.If you would like to learn more â€” such as how it works, how to integrate Meme Bridge, and how to get your blockchain supported â€” please continue reading below.

**Working principle**

Meme Bridge's instant cross-chain bridging functionality is powered by a cross-chain protocol, enabling cross-chain transactions to be executed at low cost and with low latency (just 1 to 10 seconds).

The specific process is as follows: When a user initiates a bridging operation, Meme Bridge first provides a quote detailing the estimated time and cost of the bridging process. Once the user accepts the quote, the order enters the verification phase. Upon verification, the transaction is directly initiated through the cross-chain protocol, which then completes the entire bridging process on the target chain.
