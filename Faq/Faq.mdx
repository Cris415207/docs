### **1.What do I need to use Meme Bridge?**

Have a digital wallet that supports the target blockchain; The wallet holds tokens that need to be interchained, as well as native tokens (ETH, BNB) that pay interchain fees.

### **2.How long does it take to transact across the chain?**

Regular cross-chaining of mainstream public chains (Ether, BSC) is usually completed within 1 minute; may be extended to 5-10 minutes in case of network congestion or delayed block confirmations. Users can check the progress of cross-chaining in real-time in the platform's ‘Transaction History’.

### **3.How are Meme Bridge's fees calculated?**

- On-chain Base Fee: determined by the network congestion of the originating and target chains, used to pay for the packing fees of the blockchain nodes (fluctuating with the network Gas fee);
- Platform Service Fee: a small fixed percentage of the fee charged by Meme Bridge, used to maintain the platform operation and security upgrades.

Fees are clearly displayed before the transaction and confirmed by the user before the operation is performed, with no hidden charges.

### **4.How does Meme Bridge safeguard assets?**

- Multi-signature mechanism: key operations need to be confirmed by multi-signature wallets to prevent single-point failure or malicious attacks; 
- Cross-chain protocol: user assets are executed by in strict accordance with the cross-chain protocol, and the platform does not touch the private key to avoid risks; 
- Real-time monitoring: deploying the on-chain security monitoring system to provide real-time early warning of abnormal transactions and intercept them, so as to reduce the risk of asset loss. 

### **5.What if a cross-chain transaction fails?**

If the transaction fails, the system will automatically return the assets to the wallet of the user's departure chain, and the handling fee will usually be returned (subject to the actual situation on the chain). If the assets do not arrive in time, they can be solved in the following ways: 

- Copy the transaction hash in the ‘Transaction Record’ of the platform and check the details in the corresponding blockchain browser; 
- Contact customer service and provide the transaction hash and wallet address. The staff will assist in troubleshooting; 
- Confirm whether the wallet network is switched correctly, and in some cases, the balance needs to be manually refreshed. 

### **6.Why are my tokens not in the support list? **

Meme Bridge prioritises tokens that are hot, liquid and contractually secure. If your token is not supported, you can submit a request via the official Discord or Twitter, and the team will regularly update the support list by evaluating the token's compliance, security, and community needs.
