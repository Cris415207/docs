For most systems, adapting to a new blockchain typically involves a series of steps, such as deploying contracts, facilitating consensus among participants, or establishing liquidity pools. However, Meme Bridge takes a fundamentally different approach: it only requires a cross-chain protocol to operate on the new chain, and the entire process can be initiated and run directly without any permission.

In today's rapidly evolving blockchain landscape, this advantage is particularly crucial. If you wish for your blockchain to be supported, feel free to contact us at any time\!
