title: "ðŸ’° Why Meme Bridge is so cheap?"
---

When performing cross-chain bridging or asset exchanges, there are typically three types of costs involved:

- Asset transfer costs:which are the fees incurred when transferring assets from one wallet to anothe
- Order verification costs:which are used to ensure that users' orders are executed correctly
- Transaction fees:which are the fees paid to protocol providers, wallets, and other participating parties.

In most systems, order verification and transaction fee collection are conducted on the same chain as the asset transfer operation â€” and this chain is often a high-cost network like Ethereum.

However, in Meme Bridge, the situation is different: order verification and transaction fee collection are completed on a lower-cost settlement chain, while asset transfers are simplified to direct transfers between users and the cross-chain protocol. Through this approach, overall costs are minimised.
