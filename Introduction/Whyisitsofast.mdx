In traditional message-based cross-chain bridges like LayerZero, Axelar, and Wormhole, to execute an operation on Chain B, a group of participants must first reach consensus to confirm that the corresponding event has indeed occurred on Chain A. This is because Chain A and Chain B typically share liquidity pools, so it is essential to ensure that the operation on Chain A has been completed. For security reasons, this process typically takes at least several minutes.

When using a cross-chain protocol, the process is different: a single cross-chain protocol uses its own funds to directly process orders on Chain B. This means they do not need to wait for the operation on Chain A to be finally confirmed or go through the consensus process. Once a user submits an order, the cross-chain protocol will complete the transaction as quickly as possible, and the user's intended goal is achieved at this point.
